## Covid vaccine tinder:

Tinder has contacted us requesting a new app for people who have had a covid-19 vaccine. Your mission, should you choose to accept it will be to:

# MVP:
Checkbox saying user has been vaccinated
Create an app which shows a persons picture without a mask on and lets people either accept or reject a person that appears.  You are able to message any matches and store messages in database?
Users can create own profile and upload pictures
Shows more info about potential matches
Match by location (users enter location with dropdown: i.e. Edinburgh, Glasgow)

# Extensions:
Extend the vaccination validation process
Match people by vaccine type
Match people by profile information
Adjust location matching to exact locations

# Things to install:
npm i
npm i react-router-dom
